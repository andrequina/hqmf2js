Each year, 20% of Americans contract influenza (flu) (CDC 2009). Rates of infection are highest among children and immunosuppressed patients, while mortality is highest among adults over 64 years, children under 2 years and persons with chronic medical conditions (CDC 2008). More than 200,000 people are hospitalized for flurelated complications each year; 63% are 65 or older (CDC 2009; Thompson et al. 2004). The health impact of influenza on older adults is substantial and flu short vaccines are the most effective way to prevent severe illness complications and death. This measure facilitates efforts toward infectious disease prevention among a vulnerable subgroup of the population.","name":"Rationale"},"CLINICAL_RECOMMENDATION_STATEMENT":{"code":"CRS","value":"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Forces Guide to Clinical Preventive Services recommends pneumococcal vaccine for all immunocompetent individuals who are 65 and older or otherwise at increased risk for pneumococcal disease.

There is no clear standard location for documentation in EHRs of pneumococcal vaccination that is administered external to the providers  practice. The measure specification assumes that administered vaccines will be documented in the medication administration record. In a truly interoperable environment, even medications administered elsewhere could be captured in the medication administration record. In absence of such interoperability the implementer may need to look elsewhere in the medical record for evidence of vaccine administered in other setting, e.g., a preventive care screening record.","name":"Guidance"},"SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA_ELEMENTS":{"code":"OTH","value":"Report \"Patient Characteristic: Gender\" using \"Gender HL7 Value Set (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.1)\"; Report \"Patient Characteristic: Race\" using \"Race CDC Value Set (2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.836)\"; Report \"Patient Characteristic: Ethnicity\" using \"Ethnicity CDC Value Set (2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.837)\"; Report \"Patient Characteristic: Payer\" using \"Payer Source of Payment Typology Value Set (2.16.840.1.113883.3.221.5)\".","name":"Supplemental Data Elements"}},"attributes":{"MEASUREMENT_PERIOD":{"code":"MSRTP","value":"12","unit":"mo","name":"Measurement period","id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"},"MEASUREMENT_START_DATE":{"code":"MSRSD","value":"00000101","name":"Measurement start date","id":"526506A5-8B25-4835-9A4F-E9C708B213DC"},"MEASUREMENT_END_DATE":{"code":"MSRED","value":"00001231","name":"Measurement end date","id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966-MODIFIED"}},"logic":{"IPP":[{"conjunction":"AND","comparison":{"data_criteria_id":"AAC0024A-C096-468A-ACB7-E1286394CF1E","title":"Patient Characteristic: birth date","restrictions":[{"type":"SBS","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966","range":{"low":{"value":"64","unit":"a","inclusive?":true}}}]}}],"DENOM":[{"conjunction":"AND","comparison":{"data_criteria_id":"3CF573A8-34AE-408E-88D7-26A1016A140D","title":"Encounter: Encounter outpatient","restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]}}],"NUMER":[{"conjunction":"AND","preconditions":[{"conjunction":"OR","comparison":{"data_criteria_id":"10165EC8-53EE-4242-A20D-B1D21CE0DC73","title":"Medication, Administered: Pneumococcal Vaccine all ages","restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]},"restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]},{"conjunction":"OR","comparison":{"data_criteria_id":"482902EC-E214-4FB4-8C5A-85A41250573C","title":"Procedure, Performed: Pneumococcal Vaccination all ages","restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]},"restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]}],"restrictions":[{"type":"DURING","target_id":"F8D5AD22-F49E-4181-B886-E5B12BEA8966"}]}]}}
